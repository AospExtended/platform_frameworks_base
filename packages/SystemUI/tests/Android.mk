# Provide jack a list of classes to exclude from code coverage.

# package as the rest of SystemUI so they can't be easily filtered by package name.
#
# Generate a comma separated list of patterns based on the test source files under src/
# SystemUI classes are in ../src/ so they won't be excluded.

#   Input files: src/com/android/systemui/Test.java src/com/android/systemui/AnotherTest.java
#   Generated exclude list: com.android.systemui.Test*,com.android.systemui.AnotherTest*
